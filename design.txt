Designed with spring boot which loads the xls file at startup time. This can be improved to allow Initial laod via a web service or rest call

I am not really a front end designer so the front end works but is not pretty in any way.

URI's:
 List all nodes: http://localhost:8080/nodes/
 Get individual node: http://localhost:8080/nodes/A
 List all routes: http://localhost:8080/routes/
 Get individual route: http://localhost:8080/routes/2
 Create route calculation: http://localhost:8080/route/A/E?traffic=INCLUDED
 Landing page for web: http://localhost:8080/route
 WSDL: http://localhost:8080/ws/routecalculator.wsdl
 SOAP Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/ws

Assumptions:

The traffic delay adds to the distance calculations
Routes are bidirectional
